## \mainpage InMotion2-Python
#
# This is for interacting with the InMotion2 robot using Python.
#
# We assume that the following controllers are set (controlled in `pl_uslot.c`)
#
# - controller 0  : null field
# - controller 2  : zero_ft
# - controller 4  : movetopt (move to location)
# - controller 5  : static_ctl_fade (hold and fade)
# - controller 9  : trajectory_reproduce (replay a trajectory loaded into memory)
# - controller 16 : static_ctl (hold at specified location)
#
#
#
# The main files here are:
# - `interface.py` - controls the interface with the robot C code, launching, etc.
# - `shm.py` - controls reading/writing to shared memory, which the robot C code will read
