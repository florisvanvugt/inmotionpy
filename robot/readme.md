# Notes about the robot code

This is a collection of random notes relating to the InMotion2 robot code.



## Logs
You can find some messages from the robot in `dmesg`. 

Also, you can look in `/var/log/syslog` for a variety of messages.

But somehow this is not where the debug messages go.
Debug messages are generated by calling `dpr()` in `write.c`, which seems to write to some buffer.

When the buffer is flushed (`dpr_flush()`) the contents are written to a pipe using `rt_pipe_write()`. The pipe is `ob->eofifo`, which is created in `fifo.c`. It seems that when you create these pipes using `rt_pipe_create()` you can give it a particular name (in our case these look like `crob_in` or `crob_error` and they are defined in `pipes.h`). Xenomai will then create a symbolic link `/proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/NAME` (where `NAME` is the string identifier) to a node `/dev/rtp*`.
